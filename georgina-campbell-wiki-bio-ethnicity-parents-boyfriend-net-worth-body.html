She is best known for her acting career, but she also works as a model. She has two sisters, an older one named Sarah and a younger one named Ellie – their father is from Jamaica, and works as a police officer, while their mother is British and works as a health and social care teacher. Her parents are divorced, and Georgina also has a stepfather.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>When she was just five, she had a dream of becoming an air hostess, but that never worked out. Georgina attended and graduated from Royal Holloway University of London in 2014, with a degree in film studies, and plans to do a masters in the future.</p><p>She started acting in a rather unusual way – she was approached by film director Sarah Walker on the street, who asked her if she was an actress. After saying no, she was told about an audition which she then attended, and got herself her first role.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Georgina’s career started with her lead role of Lucy in the online drama “Freak”, shot in 2009. She had numerous minor roles in TV series after that, until in 2014 she got the role of Ashley Jones in <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Murdered by My Boyfriend”</a>, which brought her to notice; it’s her favorite role because she saw Ashley as a real person with real family and friends. People had big expectations of her in this role and she didn’t disappoint them. She explains how the movie is heartbreaking and life-changing and how it impacted her so much. Her performance won her a BAFTA award.</p><p>After 2014, Georgina appeared again in a number of TV series but only for an episode or two. Some of her noticeable appearances were in the “Tripped” Mini Series in 2015 in which she had a main role, the “Flowers” TV series in which she appeared in six episodes, and eight episodes of “Broadchurch”, in the role of detective Constable Katie Harford.</p><p>Her most important appearance in films was in <a rel=nofollow href=#>“King Arthur: Legend of the Sword”</a> in 2017 – even though it was only a small role, it helped Georgina to be seen, as the movie was a big success, described by her as the most epic film that she has ever done. It was filmed in the same studio as “Harry Potter”, and she met some of her favorite actors – Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. It collected $150 million at the box office, and has an IMDb rating of 6.8/10.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>Georgina has never said openly that Tom Freight, a music maker, is her boyfriend, but she often posts pictures of them together on different occasions, which started rumors that they were dating. On 22 September 2017, the two of them spent the Christmas holidays together in Central Park, New York.</p><p>Georgina has never married, and doesn’t have any kids.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Georgina is currently 26 years old, has long black hair and dark brown eyes. She is 5ft 6ins (1.67m) tall, and weighs around 128lbs (58kg). She has an hourglass-shaped figure, and has a tattoo on her right biceps as well as a pierced septum.</p><p>There are no authoritative sources of Georgina’s net worth, but it is estimated to be more than $1 million. She has an annual income of up to $200,000, depending on the roles she plays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Campbell.jpg><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Georgina is very active on her <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a> account – it has 700 posts and is followed by almost 29,000 people. During an interview, Georgina admitted that one thing which she doesn’t like about herself is the fact that she wants attention, and to be liked.</p><h2><span id=Awards>Awards</span></h2><p>She was the first black actress to win the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award for Best Actress for her role in “Murdered by My Boyfriend” shot in 2014.</p><p>Huffington post put Georgina amongst 12 rising stars of 2018.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_favorites>Hobbies and favorites</span></h2><p>Georgina’s hobbies include travelling, watching movies and reading – her favorite travel destination is The Maldives, while her favorite book is <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Metamorphosis”</a> by Franz Kafka. Her favorite actress and the one who motivates her the most is Olivia Colman. Georgina’s favorite food is chocolate, or anything made of chocolate.</p><p>Her favorite movie genre is comedy; she has said in several interviews that she wants to do more comedy movies, but that it’s a very difficult form of acting, and isn’t sure how funny she is.</p><h2><span id=Her_plans_for_the_future>Her plans for the future</span></h2><p>Georgina claims to not have a grand plan for her future – she describes plans as something which can be devastating for you if you don’t make them work out. She does, however, plan to act in more plays – the last play she appeared in was “Even Stillness Breathes Softly Against a Brick Wall” in 2017.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><p>She has a pet hamster called Nigel and wants to have a pet rat, but nobody in her family agrees.</p><p>People tend to confuse her with another Georgina Campbell, who is a leading food and hospitality writer from Ireland.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunCzxKipoKGelnqkrcypmZ6knGLEqrfIZpmip12awam6yJygrbFdpa6zsc2tqmaan66zs7XEp5tmppWperi70a2fZpqfmcZw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorgina-campbell-wiki-bio-ethnicity-parents-boyfriend-net-worth-body.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgeorgina-campbell-wiki-bio-ethnicity-parents-boyfriend-net-worth-body.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgeorgina-campbell-wiki-bio-ethnicity-parents-boyfriend-net-worth-body.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgeorgina-campbell-wiki-bio-ethnicity-parents-boyfriend-net-worth-body.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorgina-campbell-wiki-bio-ethnicity-parents-boyfriend-net-worth-body.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorgina-campbell-wiki-bio-ethnicity-parents-boyfriend-net-worth-body.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jumpstart-weight-loss-in-your-40s-with-these-strength-exercises-trainer-says-eat-this-not-that.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jumpstart-weight-loss-in-your-40s-with-these-strength-exercises-trainer-says-eat-this-not-that.html>Jumpstart Weight Loss In Your 40s With These Strength Exercises, Trainer Says Eat This Not That</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./frank-gotti.html>Inside Frank Gotti's Death And The Revenge Killing Of John Favara</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./frank-gotti.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
