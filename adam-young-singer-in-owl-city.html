Singer and songwriter best known for his electronic project Owl City, whose independently released debut album reached #15 on the U.S. Dance chart.

Among the software that he began with was Reason from Propellerhead. He began uploading songs recorded in his parents’ basement to Myspace. He started to receive favorable attention for his music and then helped cultivate this nascent fanbase by being an open and accessible web presence, responding to any messages he received and constantly posting blogs. His manager Steve Bursky later highlighted the significance of Young’s engaging online manner in building his following saying: “People feel like they know him, like they’ve got a direct connection to him because of how he approaches his connection with them online.” Through a deal with the digital aggregator CD Baby, he then started making the songs available for sale through iTunes. In 2007, Owl City released an EP titled Of June, followed by the 2008 release of the album Maybe I’m Dreaming. Of June reached No.&nbsp;15 on the Billboard Electronic Albums chart, and Maybe I’m Dreaming peaked on the same chart at No.&nbsp;13.</p><p>Owl City is an American electronica project created in 2007 in Owatonna, Minnesota; it is one of several projects by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Young.

Pitchfork.com goes to say that “The surprise No.&nbsp;1 single in the country, Owl City’s ‘Fireflies’, jacks the Postal Service in such a bald-faced, obvious manner that getting into specifics feels redundant at best and tacky at worst.” In response to the suggestion that his work is derivative, Young suggested in a 2009 interview with The New York Times that Ocean Eyes is perhaps the “next chapter” after The Postal Service: “The Postal Service released a record in 2003, and that was it. There was really nothing to compare it to until some one else came along and wrote the next chapter. Maybe that’s this record. Maybe that’s this band.”</p><h2>Adam Young Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Adam Young is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.

Republic recommended Young partner up with 27-year-old manager Steve Bursky of Foundations Artist Management and the two began working together in late 2008. When later asked by HitQuarters why the label chose him for a major label act given his relative inexperience, Bursky said:</p><p align=justify>Owl City’s label deal with Universal Republic was finally confirmed in February 2009. According to Bursky there was initially some disagreement about the direction Owl City should follow, telling HitQuarters: “They were ready to send him into the studio with big producers and polish him up to try to become this thing that he wasn’t. But we put our foot down and said, ‘Look, the reason you signed this kid is because it’s working. Whatever it is about him—his music, his interaction with his fans, his brilliance in the online space—these things are connecting with people, and as soon as you change that you lose what’s special about this artist.’ To their credit, they really listened and they got it.”</p><h2>Who is Adam Young Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Adam Young</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
