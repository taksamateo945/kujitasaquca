Betteridge denied murdering Mr Hamilton insisting he only acted in self defence</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Betteridge, 18, was found by police nearby. He live streamed his arrest on Instagram and ‘feigned ignorance’ of the stabbing and then showed ‘righteous indignation’ at being stopped and searched.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He denied murdering Mr Hamilton, claiming he had acted in self defence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Betteridge was found not guilty of murder following a three week trial but was convicted of manslaughter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The court heard that Mr Hamilton and his friends had assaulted Betteridge and his friend Lennie Hansen when the two groups clashed in The Square in Bournemouth, Dorset, at 1.30am on August 5.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the scuffle Betteridge, from Portsmouth, picked up a kitchen knife Hansen had earlier dropped in a flowerbed for fear of being caught with it by the police.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harrowing CCTV footage shows Betteridge holding the knife while being chased by Mr Hamilton and two friends.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He then stopped, turned around and stabbed Mr Hamilton three times.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After he and Hansen were charged over the incident, a conversation between the pair was recorded in a police van. Betteridge said: ‘He banged me once at the wall and I just shanked him, in his chest bruv…worst case I’ll be out in 12 years for manslaughter.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>John Price KC, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court the fight was sparked for ‘obscure’ reasons when Mr Hamilton pushed Betteridge into the flowerbed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Price told the jury: ‘This was a wholly unnecessary and tragic culmination of a familiar and depressing tale of town centre violence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Mr Hansen had taken a knife into Bournemouth and hid it in the flowerbed as there was a high police presence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘What seemed an unremarkable encounter between two groups escalated for obscure reasons and Mr Hamilton pushed Mr Betteridge into a flowerbed, then his friends started assaulting Mr Hansen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Mr Betteridge retrieved the knife from the flowerbed and despite being asked to drop it, stabbed Mr Hamilton with it three times.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The first was in his side with no serious damage, but the second wound on his chest was of such severity nothing could be done to save him.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The court heard Betteridge and Hansen ran away.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Price added: ‘Mr (Wayne) Taylor, an off-duty security guard, said he saw the male in grey turn to the male in blue and say ‘I sliced him up, I sliced him up.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘According to Mr Taylor, he said it in an almost boastful and proud manner and he was laughing a little bit.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The court heard that Betteridge claimed one of Mr Hamilton’s friends also had a knife. A second weapon was later retrieved near the scene.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hansen, from Waterlooville, Hants, was charged with assisting an offender and was found not guilty of the offence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The family of Mr Hamilton have released a statement saying they will ‘always be truly devastated’ at his loss.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They described him as a ‘loving, caring, intelligent and polite young man’ and thanked everyone who have supported them since his death.</p><span><span style=font-size:24px;letter-spacing:-.24px><b>READ MORE: Watch as police attempt to save mortally wounded man&nbsp;</b></span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>They said: ‘We as a family still remain and always will be, truly devastated by the loss of our beautiful Cam, we will never get over his life being so horribly taken from him.

class=mol-para-with-font>Police said that Mr Hamilton’s death is the ‘starkest of reminders of the horrific consequences of knife crime’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Detective Chief Inspector Neil Third, of the Dorset Police Major Crimes Investigation Team, said: ‘Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Cameron Hamilton and nothing will ever make up for the devastating loss they have

class=mol-para-with-font>‘Our thoughts remain firmly with Cameron’s family and we hope these convictions send the clear message that violence involving knives has truly devastating
