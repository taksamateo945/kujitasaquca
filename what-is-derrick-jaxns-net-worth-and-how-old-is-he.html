The lifestyle coach is known for creating and sharing relationship advice content online and is widely regarded as an expert on all things romantic. To that extent, Derrick Jaxn has successfully grown his blogging career into a massive multi-million dollar empire – with an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p>Derrick Jaxn’s net worth is proof that he is a very successful businessman, as he has authored many helpful books, and his videos have been circulated in the nooks and crannies of the internet. So exactly how did Derrick make all his money? Let’s find out.</p><h2><strong>Derrick Jaxn’s $2 million Net Worth Comes From His Several Streams of Income</strong></h2><p>Derrick Jaxn has become famous as a video blogger and Instagram influencer. He has also written multiple relationship-based books, the sales of which amount to a decent sum of money. To amass a net worth in millions of dollars is no mean feat, but Derrick Jaxn has achieved this by diversifying his money-making endeavors into several parts. Let’s look at exactly how Derrick makes his money.</p><h3><strong>His </strong><strong>YouTube Channel </strong><strong>Contributes to&nbsp;</strong><strong>Derrick Jaxn’s Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Derrick Jaxn is a man of many talents, but perhaps his most popular niche is his increasingly viral videos which have also been the reason for his online popularity. The YouTuber and content creator launched his channel on the video-sharing platform on December 27, 2010, but was already known long before then on Instagram. As of now, Derrick boasts over half a million followers on the business and video platform.</p><p>It isn’t really clear how much he makes per post on Instagram, but there is no denying that the platform is integral to Jaxn’s earnings and total net worth. At the time of writing, he has made about 1,808 posts in total on Instagram.</p><p>Derrick’s YouTube videos have accumulated about 118 million views in the 11 years since he became active on the blog, earning him a silver play button from the site. Making money from YouTube is a factor of how many views one can accumulate and the monetization of those views. Derrick earns anywhere between $8,000 and $134,000 per year, with an average monthly viewership of nearly half a million.</p><p>YouTube is not the only social media platform Derrick Jaxn has leveraged to accentuate his increasing online personality. Micro-blogging site Twitter has not been left out of Derrick’s quest to conquer the online niche with his relationship advice. He currently has an impressive 70,000 followers on that platform as well.</p><h3><strong>Derrick Jaxn also Makes a Lot of Money from Writing Books</strong></h3><p>Now Derrick Jaxn’s videos mostly talk about matters of the heart like love, marriage, dealing with heartbreaks, and commitment in relationships. But he doesn’t just make videos, and he has also written books on all the themes mentioned above.</p><p>As an author, Derrick has written over ten books, with his debut novel, ‘A Cheating Man’s Heart’ published in November 2013. His books have gathered many positive reviews and support from his fans while boasting top-tier ratings on selling platforms like Amazon and Goodreads.</p><p><strong>Below is a comprehensive list of Derrick Jaxn’s published books:</strong></p><ul><li>A Cheating Man’s Heart</li><li>A Cheating Man’s Heart 2 (2013)</li><li>I Still Want It (2015)</li><li>I Still Deserve It (2017)</li><li>Single Mothers are for Grown Men ONLY (2017)</li><li>I’ve Come Too Far (2017)</li><li>Don’t Forget Your Crown, (2018)</li><li>A Cheating Man’s Heart 3 (2020)</li><li>Self-Crowned Journal (2021)</li><li>Heal Together without Hurting Each Other (2021)</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Derrick Jaxn Now?</strong></h2><p>Derrick Jaxn, the 34-Year-Old celebrity lifestyle coach, is an Alabama Native, a predominantly black state, but was born in Enterprise, New York, on July 20, 1989. He happens to be the youngest of five siblings, all of whom were raised by their single mom after being abandoned by their Jamaican father.</p><p>Watching his mother work several low-paying jobs to take care of all her kids shaped Derrick’s life and was part of his motivation to get himself and his family out of poverty. He had his college education at the Tuskegee University College of Business and Information Science. As a college student, he was very interested in sports and played mostly football.</p><p>In fact, the 6-feet-5-inches tall student bagged multiple football championship wins for his University. With time, however, Derrick’s interests shifted again. This time to literature, but not before he graduated in 2012 with a B.Sc degree at the age of 23.</p><p>While he was still a college student, Derrick Jaxn chaired many non-profit mentorship groups for teenagers. He was a passionate community leader, and so after graduating, due to his stellar CV, Derrick had few problems landing a sales and marketing position in a Fortune 500 company.</p><h3><strong>At </strong><strong>34</strong><strong>, Derrick Jaxn has Accomplished so Much In Less Than 10 Years of Being in the Spotlight</strong></h3><p>In what we can now refer to as a humble beginning, the relationship guru initially began his coaching career as a simple blogger. Then, he ran a personal blog where he spoke about how people could have better relationships, including all the dos and don’ts. While he had been active since his late teens, he didn’t join YouTube until he was about 21. That was around 2010.</p><p>However, Derrick Jaxn’s big break came after he had written his first book. The book, ‘A Cheating Man’s Heart,’&nbsp;was published in 2013, when he was just a 24-year-old young man. It immediately became a bestselling hit, causing him to release two subsequent books in the series with the titles, ‘A Cheating Man’s Heart 2’ and ‘A Cheating Man’s Heart 3’, with each grossing over a million copies in sales.</p><p>From creating a blog to becoming famous off of Instagram, and later, YouTube, you cannot deny that Jaxn is a true millennial who doesn’t hesitate to make proper use of the internet. By the time Derrick was 30, he had made well over a million dollars from both the sale of his books and from his YouTube viewership.</p><p>The author and philanthropist got married in 2018 to Da’Naia Broadus when he was 29 years old, and they have two beautiful children together. And despite an infidelity scandal that almost tore their family apart, they are still holding on and going strong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSprdNmoKxllJq%2Fs7XCpGSjmaijwG66xK1ksKeiqbVurc2dZKGnp2K8rbCMoqpmoJVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-derrick-jaxns-net-worth-and-how-old-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-derrick-jaxns-net-worth-and-how-old-is-he.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-derrick-jaxns-net-worth-and-how-old-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-derrick-jaxns-net-worth-and-how-old-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-derrick-jaxns-net-worth-and-how-old-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-derrick-jaxns-net-worth-and-how-old-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mama-cass-elliot.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mama-cass-elliot.html>Mama Cass Elliot</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./2765973-anfernee-simons-to-declare-for-2018-nba-draft-drew-rosenhaus-tells-espn.html>Anfernee Simons to Skip College, Declare for 2018 NBA Draft | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and R</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./2765973-anfernee-simons-to-declare-for-2018-nba-draft-drew-rosenhaus-tells-espn.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
