People born between June 23 to August 22 are Leo by the sun sign. Lions represent Leos and are the ‘leaders’ or rulers of the zodiac signs.&nbsp;</p><p>People often perceived Leos as natural leaders and fiercely ambitious.</p><p>This summer sign is ruled by the Sun and belongs to the fire element signs alongside Aries and Sagittarius. It causes Leo to have a fixed modality – meaning they have a fixed and unchanging set of personality traits and characteristics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leo-personality-1024x536.jpg> <span class=kb-table-of-contents-title>Table of Contents</span><ul class="kb-table-of-content-list kb-table-of-content-list-columns-1 kb-table-of-content-list-style-none kb-table-of-content-link-style-underline"><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Leo personality traits</a></li><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Leo Characteristics</a><ul class=kb-table-of-contents-list-sub><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Leo Positive traits</a></li><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Leo negative traits</a></li></ul></li><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Leo in relationships</a><ul class=kb-table-of-contents-list-sub><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Signs romantically compatible with Leo</a></li></ul></li><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Leo Career</a></li><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Leo Health Issues</a></li><li><a class=kb-table-of-contents__entry href=#>Some famous Leo personalities</a></li></ul><p><strong>Some general information about the Leo sun sign:</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td>July 23 to August 22</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Symbol</strong></td><td>The Lion/ ♌</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Element</strong></td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ruling planet</strong></td><td>The Sun</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lucky Numbers</strong></td><td>1, 4, and 9</td></tr><tr><td>L<strong>ucky Colors</strong></td><td>Orange, gold, and red</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lucky day</strong></td><td>Tuesday and Wednesday</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lucky Gemstone</strong></td><td>Peridot and ruby</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Associated Organ</strong></td><td>Heart/blood</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_792bfb-da wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_792bfb-da>Leo Characteristics</h2><p>Like everything in the world, the fire sign has good and evil. Leo wants to be the center of attention and be bossy. It might be beneficial in some situations while backfiring in others.</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_0aaba6-1e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_0aaba6-1e>Leo Positive traits</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leo-July23-Aug22.jpg><p>If you ever come across a Leo, you’ll probably recognize them by their joyful and radiant personality. When they receive attention from others, they enjoy it more than anything else. It makes them confident and stands out from the crowd in most situations.</p><p>There is nothing more critical to Leos than living life to the fullest. They are courageous and ambitious and take pride in what they do. It’s hard to change Leo’s mind once they’ve made up their minds!</p><p>Leos may seem coldhearted and ruthless at first glance, but the truth is quite the opposite. Warmth and energy are what you would expect from a planet ruled by the Sun, the world’s most significant energy source.</p><p>Although Leos are determined leaders, they are also compassionate and generous. They love with all their hearts when it comes to making their loved ones happy. So be prepared to be showered with affection, gifts, attention, and time if you win Leo’s heart.</p><p>Another powerful trait among Leos is self-confidence. Unapologetically themselves, they live their lives the way they want. They will also try to pass on this confidence by cheering you on. So if you’re ever feeling down, you know which sun sign to turn to!</p><p>Moreover, people belonging to the Leo sun sign are determined and goal-oriented. Therefore, they are only happy once they accomplish their goals.</p><p>Represented by the jungle king, a Leo is not someone who will back down and take the back seat. On the contrary, they are natural leaders and have great leadership qualities. Moreover, they are not afraid to take charge of the situation. As a result, they become charismatic in professional or even casual settings.</p><p>Combine their excellent leadership skills with their ambition, focus, and determination, a perfect formula for not accepting failure and getting what you want. Additionally, Leos are charismatic and spend no time dwelling on negative energy. They have a forgiving nature for the most part and will not strike back until you rub them the wrong way, just like a lion.</p><p>Ever wondered who you should turn to for honest advice? Go to a Leo, and they will give you the straightforward advice you need to hear even though you might not want to listen to it. (They can be brutally honest sometimes.)</p><p>A Leo is always looking for a connection. They are social creatures who are there for you when you need them. Although they might have an intense demeanor, Leos are absolute sweethearts inside, making them just the perfect mix of bold and sensitive.</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_78165a-58 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_78165a-58>Leo negative traits</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leo-Traits.jpg><p>We all probably know someone who likes to boss people around and will not move from their stern opinion. Well, the chances are that person is most likely a Leo. A flame is pleasant only when you feel its warmth on a cold night; too much fire will burn you. The same is for Leo.</p><p>While their bold traits are commendable, they can also tend to go over the top with these qualities and try to be THE boss at every moment. In addition, Leos often come off as self-centered due to their stubborn and somewhat ‘know-it-all’ personality.</p><p>They often struggle to find the fine line between determination and stubbornness. People have a hard time with Leos due to their unwillingness to listen to the other person’s perspective. Their confidence turns into ego when they start thinking it’s always them who is right.</p><p>How do you know you’re arguing with Leo? Suppose the person will go to extremes to prove their point, react badly to your criticism, and eventually show arrogance. In that case, you know you are interacting with a fuming Leo. Their pride and ego matter a lot to them, and sometimes, it overshadows their otherwise compassionate nature.</p><p>Their inability to take criticism causes them to appear arrogant or rude. They want the spotlight constantly. If possible, they wish the world would revolve around them. It causes Leos to become pompous and self-centered. They desire some special treatment from people around them. They are sensitive, so getting on their nerves might cause them to lash out at you.</p><p>On the other hand, due to their generous and soft-hearted characteristics, they also tend to be naïve. They expect others to treat them with the same affection they had given, but unfortunately, that isn’t the case. So, Leos are often taken advantage of by others. They have a great set of fixed string qualities, but the catch is that they tend to take it to the extreme and go overboard with it, which leads to their bad characteristics.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_e33818-f7 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_e33818-f7>Leo in relationships</h2><p>Since people of the Leo sun sign are known for being passionate, it is no surprise that they exhibit the same behavior toward their loved ones and partners. This is because they have soft hearts and wish to treat people with love and affection while expecting the same treatment.</p><p>However, it’s not always about intensity for Leos. They also know how to sit back and show their fun and playful side. They value loyalty and sincerity. Their expectations from a partner include attention, passion, care, and loyalty.</p><p>Matching their intensity might be a difficult task for a few. Still, Leo can solve any relationship issues with proper communication due to their honest and outspoken nature.</p><p>Some famous Leo relationships: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Karli Harvey </a>with her husband, Ben.</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_28e095-c6 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_28e095-c6>Signs romantically compatible with Leo</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Libra</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aries</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sagittarius </a>share the best compatibility with this ambitious sun sign, whereas they are least compatible with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taurus</a>, Capricorn, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorpio</a>.</p><p>Having a Leo as a partner or even just a friend will bring lots of energy and fun into your life.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_23571c-c9 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_23571c-c9>Leo Career</h2><p>Leos enjoy being in the limelight, so they would excel in an environment where they are in leadership and prominent position. They can try to explore their creative sides and pursue a career in the arts and entertainment fields. Leos make excellent actors, public speakers, politicians, lawyers, and other roles that require ambition and energy.</p><p>A Leo will naturally bring extra energy, creativity, and optimism into the workplace environment. They often take charge of the situation and get things done correctly. As a result, Leo is a valuable addition to any team.</p><p>However, accumulating savings might be a problem for a Leo person. They are also impulsive buyers and spend their hard-earned earnings on themselves and their loved ones due to their generous nature.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_3de848-18 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_3de848-18>Leo Health Issues</h2><p>Leos might face complications in the heart, blood, and spine conditions. In addition, they have a risk of getting strokes, irregular blood pressure, and other medical conditions. Therefore, they should be mindful and conscious of these health issues and seek medical health immediately if they face any problems.</p><p>Furthermore, Leos are also considered more prone to fevers and backaches.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_f180fd-0e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_f180fd-0e>Some famous Leo personalities</h2><p>Jennifer Lawrence, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie Jenner</a>, Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Lopez, Audrey Tautou, J.K. Rowling, Napoléon Bonaparte, Henry Ford, Barack Hussein Obama, James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chris Hemsworth, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Affleck</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cole Sprouse</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan Sprouse</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Cameron</a>, Mick Jagger, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt LeBlanc</a>, Daniel Radcliffe, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tawny Kitaen</a>, Roger Federer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Coolio</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Juana Ahumada</a>, and many more.</p><p>Overall, Leos are fantastic bubbles of energy and charisma. They’re a great companion to have in anyone’s life. It’s best to stay on their good books as their temper might be a little harsh, but their wholeheartedness and compassion often make up for it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo6%2FRoquim6NjsLC5jqWcqGWgmr%2B0u82ao6KsqWLBs63Irapo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleo-personality-traits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fleo-personality-traits.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fleo-personality-traits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fleo-personality-traits.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleo-personality-traits.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleo-personality-traits.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10125517-nba-rumors-mavs-intent-on-keeping-jared-dudley-on-kidds-staff-amid-lakers-buzz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10125517-nba-rumors-mavs-intent-on-keeping-jared-dudley-on-kidds-staff-amid-lakers-buzz.html>NBA Rumors: Mavs 'Intent' on Keeping Jared Dudley on Kidd's Staff Amid Lakers Buzz | News, Scores, H</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./joshua-jackson-wife-jodie-turner-smith-show-off-their-fashion-a-game-at-gucci-show-in-milan.html>Joshua Jackson &amp;amp; Wife Jodie Turner-Smith Show Off Their Fashion A-Game at Gucci Show in Milan!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./joshua-jackson-wife-jodie-turner-smith-show-off-their-fashion-a-game-at-gucci-show-in-milan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
