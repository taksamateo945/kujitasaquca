According to sources, the screenwriter celebrates her birthday every 10th of July. However, it is common knowledge that she was born in the late eighties, 1987. Born and bred in Los Angeles, California, Dylan is an American national, but her ethnicity is listed as White.</p><p>She has never mentioned her parents in the public space; thus, their identities and professions are unknown. The only known member of Dylan’s family is her sister, who goes by the name Madeline Meyer.</p><p>Being born in California, Dylan achieved her academic qualifications there. For her basic education, the LA native passed through Crossroads School located in Santa Monica, CA. She joined College, Bennington, VT, for her higher education, graduating with a Bachelor’s degree. However, her course of study has never been mentioned in public.</p><h2><strong>Is Dylan Meyer an Actress?</strong></h2><p>Yes. Dylan is a screenwriter and actress. According to her same-sex partner, Kristen Stewart, she first crossed paths with Dylan Meyer on the set of a movie. While Stewart omitted to specify the particular film, Dylan has written and co-starred in several productions on both the big and small screen.</p><h3><strong>A Look At Her Work as a Screenwriter</strong></h3><p>The American screenwriter does not just take the credit for writing the Netflix film XOXO (starring the likes of Sarah Hyland) in 2016, and she also functioned as its executive producer. However, Dylan is best recognized as the writer of another Netflix movie, Moxie – an Amy Poehler-directed production.</p><p>She also worked with the crew of the sci-fi television series Miss 2059, where she penned many episodes. Her 2015 project was writing the short movie Loose Ends, and in 2019, she wrote Rock Bottom.</p><h3><strong>These are her Major On-screen Appearances</strong></h3><p>Dylan Meyer does not have a long list of acting credits, but the Californian native has graced the screen on the sets of a few productions. In 2011, she was seen as part of the cast of The Death and Return of Superman. 2015 was when she recorded an appearance in Wrestling Isn’t Wrestling, and before the year ran out, Meyer was seen in Jem Reacts to the New Jem, including the Holograms Trailer.</p><h3><strong>Meyer is Currently Working with Kristen Stewart on a Potential Show</strong></h3><p>Talking to Vanity Fair, Dylan Meyer’s same-sex partner, Stewart, hinted that the duo is collaborating on an upcoming television show. While Dylan writes the show, Stewart is warming up to play a major role in it.</p><p>At the initial stage of their professional collaboration, Kristen was somewhat worried that their dalliance might be negatively impacted by a business relationship, and she wouldn’t want anything to spoil their romance which she described as “beautiful.” However, once the lovers got down to business, they discovered that it would be fruitful.</p><p>It took them just a week and a half to write the first episode. Steward likened their accelerated progress to “discovering a superbrain. The famous actress gave all credit to Dylan, whom she described as a “genuinely brilliant fucking screenwriter.”</p><h3><strong>Dylan Meyer is Active on Social Media</strong></h3><p>Like several other celebrities of her class, Dylan Meyer has established a presence on some major social media platforms. The screenwriter, who doubles as an actress, can be found on Instagram, with the handle @spillzdylz, where she has amassed followers of over 55.6k.</p><p>Meyer’s same-sex partner, Stewart, seems to be averse to opening her gram, but she has borrowed Dylan’s account when she has something important to relay to fans. A good example was when Kristen leveraged Dylan’s handle to urge Americans to cast their votes in the then-upcoming elections.</p><p>Dylan is also visible on Twitter @spillzdylz, which she joined in 2013. Her followers on the platform are far lesser than what she has on IG at 3369k, but it keeps increasing by the day. What you would mostly see on Dylan’s socials are pictures of animals and nature.</p><h3><strong>Here Are Some Dylan Meyer’s </strong><strong>Age Milestones</strong></h3><p>Dylan Meyer has recorded some career milestones in her acting and screenwriting professions. The LA-born actress was in her early twenties when she made her on-screen debut as Frat partier on the set of the short film Death and the Return of Superman.</p><p>Though she started from acting roles, Dylan soon diversified into other genres of the entertainment industry, such as screenwriting. With time, she became so good at the act of screenwriting, and today, the Californian native is known for her writing skills which have been described by many as excellent.</p><p>Her career achievements notwithstanding, Dylan Meyer became only a household name in 2019 after being involved in a same-sex relationship with one of Hollywood’s greats, Kristen. However, in November 2021, at the age of 34, she and her partner, Kristen Stewart, announced their engagement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmacqaGur3nMnrCeql2Wu6V5x6iuZqecmXqqv4ysn55n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-dylan-meyer-and-how-old-is-she.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-dylan-meyer-and-how-old-is-she.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-dylan-meyer-and-how-old-is-she.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-dylan-meyer-and-how-old-is-she.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-dylan-meyer-and-how-old-is-she.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-dylan-meyer-and-how-old-is-she.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jamie-lee-curtis-wears-low-cut-black-swimsuit-at-age-54-2013307.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jamie-lee-curtis-wears-low-cut-black-swimsuit-at-age-54-2013307.html>Jamie Lee Curtis Wears Low-Cut Black Swimsuit at Age 54</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./2688502-former-mlb-player-andy-marte-dies-at-age-33.html>Former MLB Player Andy Marte Dies at Age 33 | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./2688502-former-mlb-player-andy-marte-dies-at-age-33.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
