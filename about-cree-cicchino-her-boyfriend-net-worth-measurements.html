Client <a rel=nofollow href=#>@CreeCicchino</a> will star alongside <a rel=nofollow href=#>@isabelamerced</a> in the adaptation of <a rel=nofollow href=#>@johngreen</a>’s best selling novel ‘Turtles All the Way Down’!</p><p>Read more in <a rel=nofollow href=#>@DEADLINE</a>: <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/Bcr3dP5GHb</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/7IyeCvRRNk</a></p><p>— Circle of Confusion (@ofConfusion) <a rel=nofollow href=#>April 5, 2022</a></p><p>We have a piece of great news for Cree’s admirers – she’ll be seen as Daisy in the announced romantic drama “Turtles All the Way Down”. To give you a sneak peek into this movie, we’ll tell you that it follows the story of a teenager who tries to solve a mystery about a missing billionaire; it’s based on the novel of the same title by John Green, with filming completed and the movie currently in post-production.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_boyfriend>Love life and boyfriend</span></h2><p>Cree’s fans want to know all about her, so it isn’t surprising that many are interested in her love life. Cree was romantically linked to actor Jace Norman, perhaps known best for his lead role in the series “Henry Danger”. Reportedly, the two dated back in 2018, however, neither Cree nor Jace commented on these speculations about their romance.</p><p>In 2020, Cree <a rel=nofollow href=#>posted a photo on</a> her Instagram featuring herself and Jaheem Toombs standing in front of Disneyland’s castle, while Jaheem was on his knees, as though proposing to Cree. This photo caused an internet meltdown, and so Cree wrote a lengthy post explaining that they were joking, and that the ‘proposal’ was fake, confirming that she and Jaheem aren’t engaged. Jaheem is also an actor, and the two are close friends; they starred together in “Nickelodeon’s Ho Ho Holiday Special”.</p><p>The newest rumor about Cree’s romantic life is that she might be dating Felix Mallard, with whom she acted in the announced movie “Turtles All the Way Down”, however, Felix is in a relationship with Zoe Cramond, so this rumor appears to be false.</p><p>As of July 2023, it seems that Cree is single.</p><h2><span id=Age_measurements_and_net_worth>Age, measurements, and net worth</span></h2><p>The young actress recently celebrated her 21st birthday, and many of her fans commented that she’s growing up into a real beauty. She has long brown hair and dark brown eyes, and seemingly likes to experiment with hair colors, recently dying several strands of her hair pink. When it comes to her measurements, she has a slim figure, stands at a height of 5ft 6ins (1.65m), weighs around 120lbs (55kgs), with vital statistics of 34-24-35.. Cree has a tattoo of a small bird on her shoulder, and one on her finger – a tattoo of a heart, the same as her mother has.</p><p>If you have wondered how rich this young actress is, thanks to her talent she’s made a good living for herself. According to sources as of July 2023, Cree has a net worth estimated at over $500,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmmpqfqsFur9GenGabmZiwqbXNqGShnaJir7DFxaugnqaUYrumwIywpqusmGK6pq3SrqmepZWjwbR7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabout-cree-cicchino-her-boyfriend-net-worth-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fabout-cree-cicchino-her-boyfriend-net-worth-measurements.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fabout-cree-cicchino-her-boyfriend-net-worth-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fabout-cree-cicchino-her-boyfriend-net-worth-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabout-cree-cicchino-her-boyfriend-net-worth-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabout-cree-cicchino-her-boyfriend-net-worth-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-is-lauren-tewes-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-is-lauren-tewes-now.html>Where Is Lauren Tewes Now?
