He’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>only known for</a> being the second son of American model, socialite and social media personality Khloé Kardashian, and Canadian-American professional basketball player Tristan Thompson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rs_925x1024-230918141331-F6KNWhZaoAAKtcS.jpg><h2><span id=Parents_and_early_life>Parents and early life</span></h2><p>Tatum’s being raised in Los Angeles, California by his parents, who have been known to often break up and then reconcile; he spends more time with his mother than with his father, but Tristan’s still quite involved in his son’s upbringing.</p><p>Tatum was unnamed for the first 10 months of his life because his parents couldn’t agree on his name; he was only known as Baby Kardashian during that time. Tatum has an on older sister, True Thompson to whom Khloé gave birth in 2018; it’s widely believed that Khloé’s having a hard time connecting to her son because he was born via surrogacy.</p><h2><span id=Height_age_and_net_worth>Height, age and net worth</span></h2><p>Tatum’s age is one. His hair and eyes are brown, he weighs around 20lbs (9kgs) and is 2ft 4ins (1.75m) tall.</p><p>His mother <a rel=nofollow href=#>Khloé’s net worth’s</a> been estimated at over $60 million as of October 2023, and his father Tristan’s at over $45 million.</p><h2><span id=Khloe_Kardashian_Wiki_Bio>Khloé Kardashian Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Khloé Alexandra Kardashian was born under the zodiac sign Cancer on 27 June 1984, in Los Angeles; she’s probably known best for being a member of the Kardashian family, and for having starred in their own reality show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians”, which aired from 2007 through 2021.</p><p>Khloé was raised in Los Angeles alongside her sisters Kim and Kourtney, by their father Robert who was a lawyer, and mother Kris who was a housewife; Robert and Kris divorced in 1991 and Kris went on to marry American former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Caitlyn Marie Jenner (who was Bruce back then but eventually changed his gender).</p><p>Khloé <a rel=nofollow href=#>often switched schools</a> while growing up, matriculating from Alexandria Academy aged 17.</p><p>Her rise to fame can be attributed to her prominent presence in the world of reality television. The Kardashian family’s reality show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” served as the launch pad for her career; it provided an intimate look into the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family, and Khloé’s charismatic personality quickly garnered her a substantial following.</p><p>Her reality TV journey extended beyond the main series; she went on to co-star in several spin-off shows, including “Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami” and “Khloé & Lamar” These spin-offs explored different aspects of her life and relationships, providing viewers with deeper insights into her world.[</p><p>Beyond television, Khloé’s diversified her career by venturing into entrepreneurship; with her sisters, she was the co-owner and CEO of the clothing store D-A-S-H, which further solidified her presence in the fashion industry. In 2016, she launched her own fashion brand – Good American – which has gained popularity for its approach to sizing.</p><p>Khloé’s also quite popular on social media networks, as she’s amassed a considerable following on platforms such as Instagram and Twitter; her authentic and engaging online presence has allowed her to connect with fans on a personal level, and promote her businesses.</p><p>In addition to her television and fashion endeavors, Khloé’s also an author; she published her book “Strong Looks Better Naked” in 2015, which provides readers with an insight into her personal struggles and journey towards self-improvement.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kardashian’s team addresses the unedited bikini photo of Khloe Kardashian that is being wiped from the internet:</p><p>“Khloé looks beautiful but it is within the right of the copyright owner to not want an image not intended to be published taken down.” <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/fTA8AHXIhm</a></p><p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a rel=nofollow href=#>April 7, 2021</a></p><p>Khloé Kardashian’s love life has been a subject of great interest and speculation over the years, and her high-profile relationships have often been featured in the media.</p><p>One of her most significant relationships was her marriage to former NBA player Lamar Odom; the two exchanged vows in 2009 but their marriage faced challenges, leading to their divorce in 2016. Khloé then dated French Montana, a famous rapper; their relationship was relatively brief but still garnered significant media attention.</p><p>It was her relationship with NBA player Tristan Thompson that garnered the most attention; it has had its ups and downs, including allegations of infidelity and several temporary break-ups. Despite the challenges, Khloé and Tristan have still been able to reconcile every time, including when it was revealed in December 2021 that he’d fathered a child with another woman.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Tatums_father_Tristan_Thompson>Who is Tatum’s father Tristan Thompson?</span></h2><p>Canadian-American professional basketball player Tristan Trevor James Thompson was born under the zodiac sign Pisces on 13 March 1991, in Brampton, Ontario, Canada.
