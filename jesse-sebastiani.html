He rose to prominence after he founded the YouTube channel NELK. He founded this channel with his friend and fellow YouTuber, Kyle John Forgeard. The channel features many prank videos, and they gained a lot of popularity through their pranks.</p><p>In addition, the channel features a lot of other members like Stephen Deleonardis, Lucas Gasparini, and Arthur Kulik. In addition to this, they have also appointed the Canadian moviemaker Austin Ermes as the director of their content.</p><p>In addition to pranks, the1y also like recording their daily blogs. They combine it with their pranks videos to make excellent content. Furthermore, the group is also famous for creating their slang, <strong>Full Send.</strong></p><p>According to the boys, this means, “any activity you do, give it your absolute best.” This slang would, later on, become the brand name for their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>company</strong></a>. It deals with providing clothing apparel and fitness accessories.</p><p>The Nelk Boys are trendy, and they entertain over 7 million subscribers through their YouTube channel <strong>(NELK).</strong> The channel features the boys performing different pranks like ‘Moaning in People’s Ears’ and ‘Stealing Golfers’ Balls.’ They began the channel on 6 July 2010 and have amassed over 1 billion views on their content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsgraphy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/JesseSebastiani-1.jpg><p>However, Jesse Sebastiani has been recently staying away from the channel and its videos. So fans began wondering where one of the members and one of the crucial members of the group disappeared.</p><p>Finally, after many speculations, Kyle Forgeard came forward and <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed the reason</a> for his disappearance in his Twitch stream. According to Kyle, Jesse did like appearing in videos, but it seems as if he was also taking a break from making prank videos. He said, “I just think Jesse’s kinda done with the videos and s**t, like in a way.”</p><p>Being a prankster has had its effect on the group. Some of their videos raise a loss of suspicion because they have had <strong>cops</strong> involved in their videos. He and his friend Kyle has also spent a night in jail, and they have also visited the court many times.</p><p>One such prank was when Jesse walked into a book store with <strong>fake blood</strong> all over him. He then asks for a book that helps him to cover up a crime scene. Unfortunately, the book store owners called the police on him, and the police charged him with disorderly conduct.</p><p>Before making his way onto YouTube, Jesse was a part of his self-made documentary called <strong>‘Careless Teens’</strong> which featured on MTV. In addition to this, he also made an appearance on another reality television series on MTV called ‘<strong>Losing It</strong>.’</p><p>Apart from this, Jesse Sebastiani is active on social media platforms.

However, he shares a lot of pictures on his Instagram with different ladies. This makes it harder to determine if he is partying and chilling with his friends or hooking up with someone.</p><p>However, he was in a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, <strong>Liv Pereira,</strong> back in 2015. Unfortunately, their relationship ended in 2017, and the public bashed him for breaking up.</p><p>This disappointed him, and he even expressed his feelings by saying he hates fame. Furthermore, he adds, “I have lost almost everything I used to love about life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsgraphy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jesse_Sebastiani.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth_of_Jesse_Sebastiani></span>Net Worth of Jesse Sebastiani<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jesse makes a decent amount of earning as a member of the Nelk boys.
